# Coherence-in-ml Project: Specificity, Personal Context, Sensory Details, and Causal Coherence

Welcome to coherence-in-ml project repository! This project involves analyzing text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to explore and differentiate various linguistic aspects such as specificity, personal context, sensory details, and causal coherence. The repository contains code, data, and documentation related to this multifaceted analysis.

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into different linguistic features in text data, leveraging NLP techniques to gain insights and categorize texts based on specific criteria:

- **Specificity Analysis**: Determine the level of detail and uniqueness in stories to differentiate specific from non-specific stories.

- **Personal Context Analysis**: Explore how personal contexts influence the tone and content of text, contributing to a deeper understanding of the author's perspective.

- **Sensory Details Analysis**: Analyze sensory details in text to understand how vividly authors describe experiences, settings, and emotions.

- **Causal Coherence Analysis**: Investigate causal relationships within text, identifying how events and actions are connected and contribute to the coherence of the narrative.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/femaleprog/coherence-in-ml.git`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Explore the Data**: The datasets are located in the `data` directory. You'll find JSON files containing stories, named entities, events, labels, and other relevant information.

4. **Run the Code**: The project includes multiple analysis scripts, such as `specificity_analysis.py`, `personal_context_analysis.py`, `sensory_details_analysis.py`, and `causal_coherence_analysis.py`. Customize and run the code for each aspect of analysis.

5. **Evaluate the Results**: Run the code for different analyses and evaluate the results based on appropriate metrics.

## Code Overview

Each aspect of analysis is implemented in a separate script:

- `specificity_analysis.py`: Analyzes specificity using NLP techniques and calculates metrics.
- `personal_context_analysis.py`: Explores personal context and its impact on text analysis.
- `sensory_details_analysis.py`: Analyzes sensory details to understand descriptive richness.
- `causal_coherence_analysis.py`: Investigates causal relationships within text for coherence assessment.

## Evaluation Metrics

Each analysis may have its own set of evaluation metrics, tailored to the specific criteria being explored.
