1,the loss of my father will forever leave an indelible mark on my heart it also provided me with an unwavering strength. It shaped me into a more resilient and compassionate person capable of facing adversity with newfound determination. I carry my father's memory with me drawing inspiration from his life and the lessons he imparted. Through this turning point I have learned that strength can emerge from even the darkest moments and I am committed to living a life that honors his legacy.
2,I adopted a cat 7 months ago i wasn’t planning it and it was like a dream to me. And one day my mom entered the house with a kitten in her hands and it was the happiest day of my life i couldn’t believe it. And since then lili ( my cat) became the only being that i really love from the bottom of my heart
3,When I was younger the most important thing for me was getting attention from the people around me. It would range from learning random science things to make myself look like I'm some sort of a prodigy child to stuff like learning how to play as many sports as possible to look like I was athletic (I wasn't that good at any of them just okay). The turning point for me on this one was when I became depressed during the pandemic. Being locked inside is the easiest way to get no attention from people it didn't help that I was a bit introverted so I had barely any social media presence. My bout with depression would eventually end with the help of a psychologist but it did leave a mark. I had to repeat my first year in college due to the situation I started getting very defensive when it came to meeting new people and I started only caring about my own image of myself (what I want to be) instead of pleasing others. At first this wasn't the best of outcomes some of it wasn't a good development but by now I'm better than ever because I worked on myself to keep thr good things that came from my experience with depression and slowly get rid of the bad ones. It's almost like a pendulum swinging from one approach and the complete opposite approach with enough time and deliberate effort you can find the equilibrium that works for you. It's not easy to say but the only person who can help you is yourself in these kinds of situations.

7,it’s so hard to cut codependent family members out entirely especially coming from a culture that perceives family as sacred. but it’s these harmful patters of codependency and abuse and this very kind of treatment you’ve described that leads to finding similar romantic relationships. it’s so damn hard to feel so alone in this world like you can’t even count on the people whom you’re supposed to feel the safest around. it feels like a huge knife to the heart. impeccably hard to look away and move ahead.
8,Yes 🙌 I set a boundary with an ex and he seems to have muted/unfollowed me. Au revoir! That was probably the universe’s way of breaking the connection for me.
9,My wife cherishes her diamond engagement ring. Six years into our marriage it disappeared. We searched everywhere—all over the house her classroom the yard—but no luck. We replaced it with a cubic zirconia copy. One afternoon 14 years later while digging in the garden I saw something: my wife’s diamond engagement ring still shiny after all these years
10,"My husband came home from the kolkhoz meeting he says 'Tomorrow we get evacuated.' And I say: 'What about the potatoes? We didn't dig them out yet. We didn't get a chance.' Our neighbor knocks on the door and we sit down for a drink. We have a drink and they start cursing the kolkhoz chairman. 'We're not going period. We lived through the war now it's radiation.' Even if we have to bury ourselves we're not going!"""
